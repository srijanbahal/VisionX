# VisionX
A modular, interactive image processing application demonstrating core classical computer vision techniques with real-time visualization.

### âœ¨ Project Overview
------------------


**VisionX** is a classical computer vision toolkit built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, showcasing 10+ foundational algorithms such as:

-   Texture analysis (GLCM),

-   Edge detection (Canny, LoG, DoG),

-   Shape detection (Hough Transform, Chain Code),

-   Region-based segmentation (Region Growing, Splitting & Merging),

-   Image enhancement (Histogram Equalization),

-   Geometric transformations (Affine Transform).

Users can upload images, tune parameters, and observe how different algorithms process the images --- all within a clean, interactive web application.
